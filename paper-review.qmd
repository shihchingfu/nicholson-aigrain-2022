## Summary

"The primary goal of this study is to investigate, using simulated data, the extent to which this 'natural' interpretation is robust and can be used to guide modelling decisions."

## Quasi-periodic Kernel

- very common for stellar activity modelling
- RVs are believed to be QP
- QP hyperparameters have natural interpretation, e.g., rotation rates, lifetimes of active regions.

- QP+cosine has power at half rotation period, c.f. RVs have power at first few harmonics.


## Methodology

- use a simple spot model to simulate tightly sampled noiseless time-series: photometric and RV
- model with QP or QPC GP
- compare hyperparameters with physical parameters of simulations
- compare photometric with RV
- degrade RV data + white noise to see effect on hyperparameters

- uses GEORGE in python
- uses EMCEE
- constant mean function


## QP + Cosine

- period half of sine term
- power in first harmonic


## Degeneracies in hyperparameters

1. generate lightcurves from GP prior
2. fit GP
3. compare fitted with known hyperparameters

- 20 replicates
- 100d length
- three evenly spaced points per day
- amplitude = 1
- period = 2, 10, 30, 60 days
- Gamma = 0.5, 2
- ell = 1,3,10 x period

validation of GP procedure

- uniform priors on log scale (?)
- thinning is good
- very few burnin of 100
- point estimate of median of posterior is used (!)
- Used K-S test on std. residuals (D statistic) to see if normal (!!)
